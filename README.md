The original calculator was designed as a supplementary tool for the book Evidence-Based Medicine: How to practice and teach it by Straus, Richardson, Glasziou, & Haynes.

The statistics calculator was created for your own personal use and testing purposes. It is to be used as a guide only. Medical decisions should not be based solely on the results of this program. Although this program has been tested, the accuracy of the information cannot be guaranteed.
